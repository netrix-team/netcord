> A complete rewrite. Cleaner. Smarter. Async-native.

### âœ¨ What's New

* **Full Asynchronous Support**: Built entirely on `httpx.AsyncClient` for non-blocking HTTP interactions.
* **Pydantic Models**: Structured responses using `pydantic` for type safety and validation.
* **OAuth2 Flow Simplified**: Easily exchange codes for tokens and retrieve user data.
* **Scope Management**: Support for `identify`, `email`, and `guilds` scopes.
* **CDN Helpers**: Generate direct URLs for avatars and icons with format detection (`.gif`/`.png`).
* **Custom Exceptions**: Clear and informative error handling built upon `fastapi.HTTPException`.

### ðŸ”§ Configuration

Set up your credentials once:

```python
from netcord import Netcord

client = Netcord(
    client_id='your_client_id',
    client_secret='your_client_secret',
    redirect_uri='https://yourapp.com/callback',

)
```



Then, use the client to interact with Discord's API seamlessly.
